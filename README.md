## Introduction

Welcome to RLRoverLab! This project implements a suite of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents using Isaac Sim and [Isaac Lab](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/). Our suite currently supports a variety of tasks within navigation and manipulation, with ongoing efforts to expand our offerings.
## Features

- **Navigation and Manipulation Tasks**: Implementations of RL agents designed for navigation and manipulation tasks, we are working on integrating more tasks.
- **Isaac Sim and ORBIT Integration**: Utilizes the advanced simulation environments of Isaac Sim and the ORBIT framework for realistic task scenarios.
- **Expandable Framework**: Architecture designed for easy extension with new tasks and functionalities.

## Getting Started

To get started with RLRoverLab, please refer to our [Installation Guide](https://github.com/abmoRobotics/RLRoverLab/wiki) available in the project's wiki. The guide provides comprehensive steps for setting up the suite using Docker as well as instructions for native installation.
